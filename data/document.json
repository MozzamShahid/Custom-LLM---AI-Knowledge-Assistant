        "document_title": "Document 1: Introduction to ROYA, Sleeping Beauty Bot, and Flexxable Automation Support",
        "document_content": "Flexxable is a specialised AI automation agency that provides tools, templates, and workflows to help agencies, marketers, and business owners generate leads, manage clients, and automate sales processes. Central to this ecosystem is ROYA, which is a prebuilt snapshot system designed to accelerate onboarding, funnel setup, and automation for clients. ROYA snapshots include prebuilt pipelines, Hand Raiser Funnels, workflows, automations, and pre-designed ads, making it easier for users to implement complex marketing campaigns without starting from scratch. The Sleeping Beauty Bot is one of the main automation tools provided within ROYA. It’s designed for lead reactivation, nurturing, and follow-ups, particularly targeting contacts who have previously interacted with a business but did not convert. Using SMS, email, and AI-generated sequences, the Sleeping Beauty Bot helps turn dormant leads into active opportunities. This bot operates seamlessly within GoHighLevel (GHL) accounts, connecting leads to pipelines and automations while keeping all communications organised and GDPR compliant.\n\nThe process begins with importing a ROYA snapshot into a connected GHL subaccount. This snapshot contains everything needed for a complete automation setup: the pipeline structure, workflows, Hand Raiser Funnels, prebuilt ads, and automation triggers. After importing, the client must ensure that workflows are switched ON and triggers are properly configured, such as “form submission” or “tag applied.” Once live, the Sleeping Beauty Bot automatically engages leads through scheduled messages and emails, personalising communications based on lead behaviour and tags.\n\nFor support and troubleshooting, the Flexxable customer support system focuses on clear, short, and actionable guidance. Common issues include snapshot import errors, pipelines not updating, or leads not appearing in GHL. Replies are structured to first confirm details, then provide precise next steps. For instance:\n\nSnapshot Import Issues: “Can you confirm which GHL account you’re importing into? Most errors happen if the snapshot is added to the wrong subaccount.”\n\nLeads Not Showing: “Every lead should appear in Opportunities. Can you check if your workflow is turned ON after importing the snapshot?”\n\nWorkflow Issues: “Can you check what trigger you used for your workflow? Most times it’s missing the ‘form submission’ or ‘tag applied.’”\n\nThe support system also provides guidance for new users and sales queries. New users are welcomed with instructions to connect their GHL account and import a ROYA snapshot, ensuring they have a live Hand Raiser Funnel for lead capture. For sales-driven queries, the focus is on running prebuilt ads within the snapshot, connecting leads straight to pipelines, and showing users where to activate them efficiently.\n\nFlexxable encourages a step-by-step approach: importing the snapshot, activating workflows, confirming pipelines are capturing leads, and ensuring automations are functional. Users are guided to personalise pipelines, automate lead tags, and track every opportunity efficiently. The agency also offers guidance on leveraging AI tools to enhance outreach, ad copy, and messaging, creating a fully automated lead generation system."

        "document_content": "At Flexxable, our customer support is designed to be clear, concise, and action-oriented, ensuring clients can implement ROYA snapshots, Sleeping Beauty Bot, and automations without confusion. Our role is to guide clients step by step, troubleshoot issues, and provide precise solutions while keeping communication friendly and encouraging. When a client reaches out, the first step is clarifying their issue. Often, messages are vague, so we ask targeted questions to understand whether they mean ROYA snapshots, GHL pipelines, Hand Raiser Funnels, or ad setup. Examples of clarifying questions include: “Do you mean inside ROYA or inside GHL?” “Are you talking about the ads setup or the funnel setup?”  “When you say it’s not working, do you mean leads aren’t showing or automations aren’t firing?” “Do you want me to guide you on importing the snapshot or activating workflows?” Once we understand the problem, we provide precise, step-by-step solutions. Each reply is tailored to the client’s workflow, whether it’s activating automations, troubleshooting snapshot imports, or connecting prebuilt ads. Examples of actionable replies include: Snapshot Import Problems: “Can you confirm which GHL account you’re importing into? Most errors happen if the snapshot is added to the wrong subaccount.” Leads Not Showing in GHL: “Every lead should appear in Opportunities. Can you check if your workflow is turned ON after importing the snapshot?” Pipeline Not Updating: “This usually means the workflow isn’t active. Do you want me to walk you through switching it on?” Ads Not Connecting: “Are you using the prebuilt Hand Raiser ads or creating your own? That’ll help me give you the right steps.” Workflow Not Running: “Can you check what trigger you used for your workflow? Most times it’s missing the ‘form submission’ or ‘tag applied.’” Our support principles emphasise being supportive and encouraging. We acknowledge client effort, guide them through learning curves, and maintain a friendly tone that reduces frustration. All replies are kept short and actionable, avoiding long explanations or unnecessary technical jargon unless the client asks for it. We also have ready-made responses for common client situations: New Users: “Welcome aboard 👋 First step is importing your ROYA snapshot into GHL. Have you already connected your GHL account?” Clients Stuck: “Got it 👍 can you share if it’s the workflow or the funnel giving you trouble? That way I can give you the exact fix.” Sales Questions: “The fastest way is to run the Hand Raiser ads in your snapshot. They connect straight to your GHL pipeline. Do you want me to show you where to activate them?” Automation Issues: “Automations won’t work unless switched ON after importing. Can you check if the toggle is active?” Pipeline Questions: “All your leads appear under Opportunities in your pipeline. Do you want me to show you how to rename the stages for your niche?” Our team ensures that every support interaction moves the client forward, whether that’s checking account permissions, activating workflows, or guiding them through tag-based automations. We document common issues and solutions so that agents can respond quickly, maintain consistency, and reduce client wait time. Ultimately, the focus of our work is to empower clients to use ROYA and Sleeping Beauty Bot effectively while providing hands-on support, clear instructions, and step-by-step guidance. This ensures that all clients—from first-time users to experienced marketers—can fully leverage the tools provided by Flexxable and get measurable results without unnecessary delays."

         "document_title": "Document 3: Common Client Questions and Flexxable Support Replies",
         "document_content": "At Flexxable, client inquiries typically fall into five main categories: Snapshot import issues, leads and pipeline visibility, workflow and automation problems, ad connectivity, and general setup guidance. Our support approach is to quickly identify the category, ask clarifying questions, and provide a precise step-by-step solution. 1. Snapshot Import Issues Clients often face errors while importing ROYA snapshots into their GHL subaccounts. Common questions include: “The snapshot isn’t importing. What should I do?” “I get an error when trying to add the snapshot to my GHL account.” “Is there a special permission needed for import?” Replies we offer: “Can you confirm which GHL account you’re importing into? Most errors happen if the snapshot is added to the wrong subaccount.” “Check if your user role has ‘admin’ permissions for that subaccount. Without it, the snapshot won’t import fully.” “Try refreshing the account and re-importing. Sometimes the cache causes the import to fail.” 2. Leads Not Showing in Pipelines Clients frequently report that captured leads aren’t appearing in their GHL pipeline or Opportunities. Questions include: “I filled out the funnel but no leads appear.” “Why aren’t my test leads showing up?” Replies we offer: “Every lead should appear in Opportunities. Can you check if your workflow is turned ON after importing the snapshot?” “Ensure your Hand Raiser Funnel is live and that tags are being applied correctly. Leads without tags may not move into the pipeline.” “Check that the funnel form submissions trigger the workflow. Often the trigger is missing.” 3. Workflow or Automation Not Running Clients sometimes see automations not firing. Typical questions: “My SMS sequence isn’t sending automatically.” “The workflow is on, but leads aren’t moving between stages.” Replies we offer:  “This usually means the workflow isn’t active. Do you want me to walk you through switching it on?”  “Can you check what trigger you used for your workflow? Most times it’s missing the ‘form submission’ or ‘tag applied.’” “Make sure all template messages exist. Missing templates can block workflow execution.”  4. Ad Setup and Connectivity Issues Some clients create or import ads but find them unlinked to the funnel. Questions include: “The prebuilt Hand Raiser ads aren’t connecting to GHL.” “I created my own Facebook ad, but leads aren’t coming in.” Replies we offer: “Are you using the prebuilt Hand Raiser ads or creating your own? That’ll help me give you the right steps.” “Verify your domain in Facebook Ads Manager. Unverified domains can block lead capture.”  “Check that the ad is linked to the correct funnel in ROYA. Sometimes the funnel connection needs to be re-synced.” 5. General Guidance and Onboarding Questions New users often ask how to start, what each tool does, and how to personalise pipelines. Common questions: “What is ROYA and how do I use it?” “What does the Sleeping Beauty Bot do?” “How do I rename stages for my niche?” Replies we offer: “ROYA is a prebuilt snapshot system with ready-to-use pipelines, funnels, workflows, and ads. Start by importing the snapshot into your GHL subaccount.” “The Sleeping Beauty Bot reactivates leads and engages them through SMS and email sequences automatically.” “You can rename stages in your pipeline from the Opportunities tab. Would you like me to show you step by step?” “For new users, first connect your GHL account, import the snapshot, and make sure workflows are ON. Then test by submitting a lead to see if it flows through the pipeline.” Support Principles in Replies: All replies are short, precise, and supportive. We encourage clients, acknowledge their effort, and guide them to the next step. Even if a client is unsure, our first action is to clarify rather than guess. For example: “Do you mean inside ROYA or inside GHL?” “Are you talking about the ads setup or the funnel setup?” This system ensures clients always receive relevant guidance without confusion and can implement ROYA, the Sleeping Beauty Bot, and automations effectively."

        "document_title": "Document 4: Example Client Interactions and Support Flow",
        "document_content": "Scenario 1: Snapshot Import Issue Client: “I tried importing the ROYA snapshot, but it’s failing.” Support Reply: “Can you confirm which GHL account you’re importing into? Most errors happen if the snapshot is added to the wrong subaccount.” Client: “It’s my main account. I think permissions are fine.” Support Reply: “Check that you have admin access for that subaccount. Without it, the import can fail. Try refreshing the account and re-importing.” Outcome: Client confirms import successful after checking permissions. Scenario 2: Leads Not Showing in Pipeline Client: “I submitted a test lead, but it doesn’t appear in Opportunities.” Support Reply: “Every lead should appear in Opportunities. Can you check if your workflow is turned ON after importing the snapshot?” Client: “Ah, the workflow was off. I switched it on.” Support Reply: “Great! Now submit another lead to verify it flows through correctly.” Outcome: Leads appear correctly in the pipeline. Scenario 3: Workflow Not Running Client: “My SMS sequence isn’t sending automatically.” Support Reply: “Can you check what trigger you used for your workflow? Most times it’s missing the ‘form submission’ or ‘tag applied.’” Client: “I only set the tag but not the form submission.” Support Reply: “Add the form submission as the trigger, and make sure all message templates exist. That should fix the automation.” Outcome: SMS sequence starts sending automatically. Scenario 4: Ads Not Connecting Client: “I’m using prebuilt ads, but no leads are coming in.” Support Reply: “Are you using the prebuilt Hand Raiser ads or creating your own? That helps me give the right steps.” Client: “Prebuilt ones.” Support Reply: “Verify your domain in Facebook Ads Manager and ensure the ad is linked to the correct funnel in ROYA. Sometimes re-syncing the funnel fixes the issue.” Outcome: Ads start sending leads to the pipeline. Scenario 5: New User Onboarding Client: “I just joined and don’t know where to start.” Support Reply: “Welcome aboard 👋 First step is importing your ROYA snapshot into GHL. Have you connected your account?” Client: “Yes, connected.” Support Reply: “Perfect. Next, activate your workflows and test your Hand Raiser Funnel with a dummy lead. This ensures everything flows into Opportunities correctly.” Support Strategy Highlights: Always clarify first if the client’s message is unclear. Guide step-by-step rather than giving long explanations. Encourage and acknowledge effort to keep clients motivated. Provide ready-made responses for common issues, so support is consistent and fast. Use follow-ups to confirm resolution and prevent repeated issues. These example logs capture the full client-support journey, showing how we handle questions, provide solutions, and ensure clients can fully leverage ROYA snapshots and the Sleeping Beauty Bot."
