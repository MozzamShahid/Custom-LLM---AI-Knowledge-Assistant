I know you can connect Google accounts, surely there is another way to do it without having access to my clients google account, I fear this might drive the client away as raise red flags (It would for me!) Is it possible to just share the calendar with them via a link where they can see each appointment booked and receive notifications? If you have a client, how do you share calendar bookings with them? Please let me know below! Cheers in advance",

    "postDescription": "Hi. After a few hurdles I got the day 3 build to work. 😁 But the initial test which is attached in the backend with test2 email etc has faulted through the conversation especially in the initial 2nd response.The second contact is me and it was near perfect. The test2 contact actually asked me to contact a phone number that was a competitor to the website i attached to the prompt. The contact in my name kept wanting to book a call and on track? Why the difference and the test contact did not follow prompt and gave number out where for the life of me I cannot see where that came from.",

    "reply": "Congrats @Christopher Krawiec well done. I agree with @Philip Wride regarding the CSV file from the client. Regarding the columns in there maybe additionally consider a 'timezone' column with IANA tz entries like 'America/New_York'. That's especially useful in case your client operates nation-wide across multiple timezones, because with that information attached to each contact in GHL it's then possible to define the allowed SMS sending times based on the *contact's* time rather than just the account time."
